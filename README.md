# Library-Management-System-SA45Team12
This is a project based on Library Management System by DipSA45, Team12a.
The name of the authors can be found within the .cs file.

This project uses Entity Framework for database transaction, and Typed Dataset for SAP-Crystal Report
The software is still very buggy. Please do not use it for actual business transactions.

You may email me as cslim@changsiang.net should you have any question or problem with the software.

Thank you.
